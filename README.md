The code calculates wet bulb globe temperature for historical ERA5 dataset (considered observed), EARTh3-CC SSP585 WBGT for historical and future period. The bias-correction is performed. Further for any desired location(lat,lon), the no of months in a year that desired location will be above a given threshold (26 deg C WBGT) is estimated. The code is yet to be polished properly with comments and will be done soon.
